# 📦 FAIR Forge SBOM Tools

These scripts are a set of production-hardened Bash utilities for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) and performing vulnerability scanning. These scripts are designed for CI/CD environments, with error handling, input sanitization, and automated cleanup.

**The Scripts:**
1. SBOM Generator     — Generates SPDX & CycloneDX SBOMs from a target directory or archive.
2. SBOM Analyzer      — Finds & Analyzes existing SBOMs within a target directory.
3. SBOM CVE Scanner   — Scans packages listed in an SBOM for known CVEs.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The following tools must be available in your environment:
| Tool & Version | Usage Requirement  |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| `jq` 1.6+      | JSON processing    |
| Syft v0.60.0+  | SBOM Generation    |
| Grype          | vulerability scanning from SBOM |
| `bash`         | script environment |
| `coreutils`    | various CLI tools  |

`coreutils` should be available by default, and includes `sed`, `grep`, `basename`, `dirname`, `mktemp`, `realpath`, and `timeout`.

External HTTP access is required for Grype to retrieve the vulnerability database. In air-gapped environments, this step must be done manually. Syft does not require an external connection except when scanning an external Docker file.

## 📥 Installation

### 📥 Install the Dependencies

#### >_ Linux/Unix

Install commands for Debian/Ubuntu & derivatives are shown. Adjust to suit your distro or package manager as needed, if not apt; _e.g._, `yum`, `rpm`, _etc._.

**1. Install jq & coreutils**

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y jq
```

Should be pre-installed, but if necessary:
```bash
sudo apt-get install coreutils
```

**2. Install Syft & Grype** from their repos:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/syft/main/install.sh | sh -s — -b /usr/local/bin
```

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anchore/grype/main/install.sh | sh -s — -b /usr/local/bin
```

#### >_ macOS, using Homebrew
```bash
brew install jq syft grype
```

#### >_ Grype Database

Grype will automatically update its database when it runs, however if external network access will not be available when running the scripts, import or update the database manually:
```bash
grype db import
```

### 📥 Install the SBOM Scripts

1. Save the scripts to a working directory (unless you're adding them to your `$PATH`).
2. Make them executable:

```bash
chmod +x sbom-gen.sh analyze-sbom.sh vuln-scan.sh
```


## 🛠️ SBOM Generator

`sbom-gen.sh`

### ✔ Features

* Uses Syft for generating SBOMs in standard formats.
* SBOM generation from a target directory, supported archive, or Docker image.
* Supports scanning of `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`, `.7z`, `.tgz`, `.xz`, and other archive types without extracting files.
* Automatically creates two `.json files` for SBOMs in both `SPDX` and `CycloneDX` formats.
* Output sanitizes filenames, enforces relative paths for privacy and security.
* Script execution includes 60-second timeout to prevent stalls.

### 💻 Usage

Run the generator against a local directory, supported archive (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`, _etc._), or Docker image.
```bash
./sbom-gen.sh <TARGET>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Scan a local directory
./sbom-gen.sh ./app-source

# Scan a Docker image
./sbom-gen.sh nginx:latest
```

**Environment Variables:**

You can pass flags directly to Syft using `SYFT_ARGS`:
```bash
# Scan only the squash filesystem of an image
SYFT_ARGS='—scope squash' ./sbom-gen.sh alpine:latest
```

### 📁 Output

The script creates two files in the current directory:
* `sbom-<sanitized_name>.spdx.json`
* `sbom-<sanitized_name>.cyclonedx.json`



## 🕵🏻 SBOM Analyzer

A robust Bash utility that scans directories for Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) sources (such as `package-lock.json` or existing SBOM files), generates standardized SBOMs on-the-fly using **Syft**, and performs a deep variance analysis against a baseline if multiple SBOMs are found. It will identify added, removed, and version-shifted packages while filtering out development dependencies to reduce noise.

### 💡 Features

* **Auto-Discovery:**       — Recursively finds SBOM-compatible files (default depth: 6), skipping `node_modules` and hidden directories for speed.
* **Intelligent Baseline:** — Automatically sorts found files by depth, prioritizing files with `*bom*`, `*spdx*`, `*cyclonedx*, and `*json*` in the file name. The highest-priority file is selected as the "Source of Truth" baseline for comparisons.
* **Noise Reduction:**      — Identifies and omits `devDependencies` from the comparison report to focus on production risks.
* **Security Hardened:**    — Includes timeouts, relative path masking (privacy), and secure filename handling to prevent injection attacks on the script itself.
* **CI/CD Ready:**          — Includes a `—json` flag for generating machine-parsable output for build pipelines.

### 💻 Usage

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
./analyze-sbom.sh [DIRECTORY] [OPTIONS]
```
*If no directory is provided, the script will default to the current directory (`.`).*

#### Options & Flags

| Flag | Long Flag      | Description |
| ---- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `-v` | `—verbose`     | Lists the specific names of added, removed, or changed packages. |
| `-j` | `—json`        | Outputs raw JSON for piping into other tools, suppressing all log messages. |
| `-n` | `—no-diff`     | Finds potential SBOMs but skips the comparison step. |
| `-d` | `—depth INT`   | How deep to search for files (Default: 6). |
| `-f` | `—filter TYPE` | Limit analysis to specific package types (_e.g._, `npm`, `python`, `binary`). |
| `-h` | `—help`        | Displays usage information. |


#### 🔍 Examples

**1. Drift Check**

Compare all lockfiles in the current directory against the highest-priority baseline.

```bash
./analyze-sbom.sh
```

**2. Verbose Audit**

See exactly *which* library versions have changed.
```bash
./analyze-sbom.sh ./backend —verbose
```

**Output snippet:**
```text
  Variances: [+] 0 new, [-] 0 removed, [Δ] 1 version changes
      [Δ] react: 17.0.2 ➔ 18.2.0
```

**3. CI/CD Integration (JSON)**

Generate a JSON report to fail a build if drift is detected.

```bash
./analyze-sbom.sh —json > sbom-report.json
```

**4. Deep Search**

If your `package-lock.json` is deeply nested (_e.g._, inside a monorepo structure).

```bash
./analyze-sbom.sh —depth 8
```

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Discovery:** The script runs `find` to locate files matching `*bom*` or `*.json`. It deliberately prunes (ignores) `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, and `.venv` to ensure performance.
2. **Baseline Selection:** When multiple SBOM files are found, list is sorted by priority, calculated as (1) the depth it is found in the directory tree (_e.g._, 0 in the target-root directory, 1 for the first subdirectory, and so on). If the filename includes any the SBOM-indicators (`spdx`, `cyclonedx`, `bom`), 0.5 is subtracted from its depth score. The highest-priority file will have the lowest number, becoming the Baseline to which any other files are compared.
3. **Parsing:** Each file is passed to `syft` to generate a standardized JSON SBOM, then `jq` filters out artifacts marked as `dev: true` or having a `dev` property.
4. **Comparison:** After `awk` compares the production dependencies of the Target vs. the Baseline, the script calculates **Additions** (in Target, not Baseline), **Removals** (in Baseline, not Target), and **Version Shifts**.


### 🛡️ Security Notes

* **Read-Only:** This script is read-only; it does not modify your lockfiles or project structure.
* **Privacy:**   Output paths are relative to the execution directory. Absolute system paths (_e.g._, `/home/user/...`) are masked.
* **Timeouts:**  Parsing operations are capped at 30 seconds per file to prevent "Zip bomb" or "JSON bomb" denial-of-service scenarios.





## ⚠️ SBOM CVE Scanner

```bash
vulncheck-sbom.sh
```
This script will review a provided SBOM and check the listed packages against a current vulnerability database. The script is recommended to be run on a CycloneDX SBOM, but will work equally with other standard SBOM formats. The script will output an updated SBOM including vulnerability information, with a file name based on the target input, _e.g._, `sbom-vulns-{target}.cyclonedx.json`. In an air-gapped or offline environment, the Grype DB must be imported manually or the script will fail.

### 💡 Features

* **Purpose:** Reads an existing SBOM and scans it for vulnerabilities using **Grype**.
* **Outputs:** A unified JSON SBOM file containing the original SBOM merged with the vulnerability report.
* **Safety:**  Redacts internal tool paths (_e.g._, `.cache/grype`) to prevent information leakage and validates JSON integrity before saving.

### 💻 Usage

Give the scanner a valid SBOM as its target file to scan.
```bash
./vuln-scan.sh <INPUT_SBOM_FILE>
```

**Example:**
```bash
./vuln-scan.sh sbom-nginx_latest.spdx.json
```

### 📁 Output

* Creates `sbom-vulns-<sanitized_name>.json`
* This file contains the full SBOM **plus** a new top-level `vulnerabilities` object containing the Grype findings.

### 🛡️ Security & Hardening Features

The script includes several protections suitable for enterprise pipelines:
1. **Write Verification:** explicitly checks if the current directory is writable before wasting CPU cycles on scanning.
2. **Anti-DoS Timeouts:**
   * `syft` is capped at **60s**
   * `grype` is capped at **120s** to allow for database updates
3. **Privacy Scrubbing:**
* SBOM generator forces relative path scanning to prevent leaking absolute server paths (_e.g._, `/home/jenkins/workspace`).
* SBOM scanner redacts internal Grype cache paths from the final JSON report.
4. **Atomic Writes:** Results are written to temporary files first and only moved to the final output file upon successful completion and validation.
5. **Strict Cleanup:** A `trap` function ensures temporary files are deleted regardless of whether the script succeeds, fails, or is prematurely terminated by `CTRL+C`.
