# Human Review

Certain trust signals will require human review, either to gather data or to evaluate it once it has been gathered electronically. The following overview provides some specific trust signals to be gathered and evaluated, though some will be for future enhancements.

## Reference Material for Human Reviewers

The following resources may be helpful in identifying factors for evaluating project or repo health as trust signals.

- .org handbook: [Performing Reviews – Make WordPress Plugins](https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/handbook/performing-reviews/)
- [OpenSSF Scorecard](https://scorecard.dev/)
- [OpenCode Badge Program](https://opencode.de/en/knowledge/software-index/badges-en)
- [Measuring the Health of Git Repositories](https://augmentable.medium.com/measuring-the-health-of-git-repositories-%EF%B8%8F-c0dea98c9ca5)
- [How to creaate a healthy GitHub repository](https://joost.blog/healthy-github-repository/)

### Other Human-Reviewed Factors as Trust Signals

- Governance model, if multiple contributors
- Nulled plugin policy
- Community reputation of Developers, Contributors, & Publisher


# Automated & Human Review

Some checks may be automated now or in future, but may not be available across different git platforms, or may require manual interpretation.

## Publisher Attestations

Beyond the basic package meta which is required by .org and/or FAIR, additional attestations may be valuable to building trust, particularly if they are electronically verifiable.

- [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) publishes an open standard with [various tools](https://github.com/in-toto) as well as an [Attestation Framework](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation) as part of its [specification](https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/blob/main/spec/README.md#in-toto-attestation-framework-spec)
- [SLSA Software attestations](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2-rc1/attestation-model)
- [SLSA Provenance](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.1/provenance) attestation model within the in-toto framework
- SLSA's [Verification Summary Attestatioin (VSA)](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.2-rc1/verification_summary) provides a schema for summarizing verified attestations
- [Verification of SLSA provenance](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) is a tool for verifying SLSA provenance generated by CI/CD builders


## Evaluating Project Health

### OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

- [OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) operates a [BadgeApp](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en) that authenticates with GitHub to scan for badge criteria. The [app has an API](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/main/docs/api.md). [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge).

### OpenCode Badge Program

- [openCode Badge program](https://opencode.de/en/knowledge/software-index/badges-en) evaluates certain criteria for a repository to be awarded 4 badges, most of which have three levels of award. They offer a [Badge API](https://gitlab.opencode.de/open-code/badgebackend/badge-api) which currently only supports GitLab respositories.

## Verifiable Credentials & Trusted Publilshers

At some point we may want to link respositories or packages with verifiably identified developers. For plugins with a vast number of users, some form of such verification could be recommended as a requirement at some point. Organizations and initiatives which may become relevant include

- [OpenID](https://openid.net/)
- [Trust Over IP (ToIP)](https://trustoverip.org/)
- [Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) is a W3C recommendation
